We are to decrypt **avktf_yh_lxwb_xam_xktpxu**. This was a caesar cipher, but you first had to reverse the order of letters in the string and then decode it (or the other way round). Instead of reversing the string manually, you could use this python trick:

> reversed_string=string[::-1]
you get **uxptkx_max_bwxl_hy_ftkva**, and upon decrypting you find your flag to be:
## beware_the_ides_of_march
