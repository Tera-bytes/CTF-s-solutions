# La espero
Our task is to find the password. After a quick google search, we realise the given sentence **“Vi estas proksima. La pasvorto ne estas en la ‘dictionary’; la pasvorto estas en la vortaro.”** is in Esperanto. Translating to english gives: **You are near. The password is not in the 'dictionary'; the password is in the dictionary**. In other words, the password is not in english but in Esperanto. Translating "girlfriend" to Esperanto and appending the salt to it gives the provided hash. Thus the flag is:

## koramikinoen-la-mondon-venis-nova-sento

Remark: The hint wasn't really necessary here,as its only purpose was to let you know you are dealing with Esperanto.
