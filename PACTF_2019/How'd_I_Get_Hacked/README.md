# How'd I Get Hacked

Firstly, I realised most of the files were of length 21. So, to be sure, I wrote a script that outputs files of lenth different from 21. To my great surprise, there was one: **flag{qdolctmyâ€®{fdp.exeâ€¬**. But, when I tried looking for that in the .dat file, it didn't exist: instead, there was one flag similar to that and which was our flag:
## flag{qdolctmy‮{fdp.exe‬
